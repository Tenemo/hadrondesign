## TODO
- navbar doesnt work on mobile
- navbar invisible burger
- webpack doesnt copy .svg to dist, silly webpack
- testing client/server
- refactor clicker code, both here and in server, there are repeating parts
- unique keys? the board array is not reordered, shouldnt be that much of an issue
- npm cache has it out for me, no amount of reinstalls fix EPERM error, I should find some other solution than rimrafing .cache
- add site manifest, pretty select colors and stuff
- prevent users from fucking up their save by choosing a long name
- letters sticking out of tiles when the size is very small
- navbar disappear after click on mobile
